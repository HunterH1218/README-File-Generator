## README Generator

This simple Python script uses Google's Gemini Pro model to generate README files for coding projects. 

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Generative AI library (`google-generativeai`)

### Installation

1. Install the required library using pip:
   ```
   pip install google-generativeai
   ```
2. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the script with your actual Google Cloud API key. 

### Usage

1. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   python readme_generator.py
   ```
2. You will be prompted to enter the input for the README file. This input should clearly describe your project, including:
    - Project title and description
    - Functionality and features
    - Installation instructions
    - Usage examples
    - Dependencies
    - License information
    - Contributing guidelines
3. The script will use the Gemini Pro model to generate a README file based on your input and print it to the console.
